  abstract = {For the complex multi-ship encounter scenarios, this article proposes a dynamic collision avoidance path planning algorithm based on the A-star algorithm and ship navigation rules, namely Dynamic Anti-collision A-star (DAA-star) algorithm. A dynamic search mechanism of the DAA-star algorithm considering time factors is designed to enable the collision avoidance for situations with known moving obstacles. A quaternion ship domain is generated based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and the navigation risk cost is calculated with the combination of the quaternion ship domain and potential field. The searching constraints conforming with the Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGS) rules are set for the DAA-star algorithm to guarantee the safety of collision avoidance. Meanwhile, the individual ship maneuverability constraints and maneuverability differences from ship to ship are both considered in the proposed DAA-star algorithm, which can solve the path planning problem with dynamic obstacles in multi-ship encounter scenarios. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional A-star algorithm and dynamic A-star algorithm, the DAA-star algorithm can generate more reasonable dynamic and static obstacle avoidance paths in complex navigation scenarios in the trade-off between the navigation risk and economical efficiency.},

  abstract = {This research introduces a path planning method based on the geometric A-star algorithm. The whole approach is applied to an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) in order to avoid the problems of many nodes, long-distance and large turning angle, and these problems usually exist in the sawtooth and cross paths produced by the traditional A-star algorithm. First, a grid method models a port environment. Second, the nodes in the close-list are filtered by the functions <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">P\left ({{x,y} }\right) </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">W\left ({{x,y} }\right) </tex-math></inline-formula> and the nodes that do not meet the requirements are removed to avoid the generation of irregular paths. Simultaneously, to enhance the stability of the AGV regarding turning paths, the polyline at the turning path is replaced by a cubic B-spline curve. The path planning experimental results applied to different scenarios and different specifications showed that compared with other seven different algorithms, the geometric A-star algorithm reduces the number of nodes by 10% ~ 40%, while the number of turns is reduced by 25%, the turning angle is reduced by 33.3%, and the total distance is reduced by 25.5%. Overall, the simulation results of the path planning confirmed the effectiveness of the geometric A-star algorithm.},

The constrained longest common subsequence (CLCS) problem was introduced as a specific measure of similarity between molecules. It is a special case of the constrained sequence alignment problem and of the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem, which are both well-studied problems in the scientific literature. Finding similarities between sequences plays an important role in the fields of molecular biology, gene recognition, pattern matching, text analysis, and voice recognition, among others. The CLCS problem in particular represents an interesting measure of similarity for molecules that have a putative structure in common. This paper proposes an exact A⁎ search algorithm for effectively solving the CLCS problem. This A⁎ search is guided by a tight upper bound calculation for the cost-to-go for the LCS problem. Our computational study shows that on various artificial and real benchmark sets this algorithm scales better with growing instance size and requires significantly less computation time to prove optimality than earlier state-of-the-art approaches from the literature.},

  abstract = {A fusion pathfinding algorithm based on the optimized A-star algorithm, the artificial potential field method and the least squares method is proposed to meet the performance requirements of path smoothing, response speed and computation time for the path planning of home cleaning robots. The fusion algorithm improves the operation rules of the traditional A-star algorithm, enabling global path planning to be completed quickly. At the same time, the operating rules of the artificial potential field method are changed according to the path points found by the optimal A-star algorithm, thus greatly avoiding the dilemma of being trapped in local optima. Finally, the least squares method is applied to fit the complete path to obtain a smooth path trajectory. Experiments show that the fusion algorithm significantly improves pathfinding efficiency and produces smoother and more continuous paths. Through simulation comparison experiments, the optimized A-star algorithm reduced path-planning time by 60% compared to the traditional A-star algorithm and 65.2% compared to the bidirectional A-star algorithm path-planning time. The fusion algorithm reduced the path-planning time by 65.2% compared to the ant colony algorithm and 83.64% compared to the RRT algorithm path-planning time.},

  abstract = {In the big data era, graph applications are becoming increasingly important for data analysis. Breadth-first search (BFS) is one of the most representative algorithms; therefore, accelerating BFS using graphics processing units (GPUs) is a hot research topic. However, due to their random data access pattern, it is difficult to take full advantage of the power of GPUs. Recently, hardware designers have integrated CPUs and GPUs on the same chip, allowing both devices to share physical memory, which provides the convenience of switching between CPUs and GPUs with little cost. BFS processing can be divided into several levels, and various traversal orders can be used at each level. Using different traversal orders on different devices (CPUs or GPUs) results in diverse performances. Thus, the challenge in using BFS on integrated architectures is how to select the traversal order and the device for each level. Previous works have failed to address this problem effectively. In this study, we propose an adaptive performance model that automatically finds a suitable traversal order and device for each level. We evaluated our method on Graph500, where it not only shows the best energy efficiency but also achieves a giga-traversed edges per second (GTEPS) performance of approximately 2.1 GTEPS, which is a

  abstract = {Graph data structures have been used in a wide range of applications including scientific and social network applications. Engineers and scientists analyze graph data to discover knowledge and insights by using various graph algorithms. A breadth-first search (BFS) is one of the fundamental building blocks of complex graph algorithms and its implementation is included in graph libraries for large-scale graph processing. In this paper, we propose a novel direction selection method, SURF (Selecting directions Upon Recent workload of Frontiers) to enhance the performance of BFS on GPU. A direction optimization that selects the proper traversal direction of a BFS execution between the push and pull phases is crucial to the performance as well as for efficient handling of the varying workloads of the frontiers. However, existing works select the direction using condition statements based on predefined thresholds without considering the changing workload state. To solve this drawback, we define several metrics that describe the state of the workload and analyze their impact on the BFS performance. To show that SURF selects the appropriate direction, we implement the direction selection method with a deep neural network model that adopts those metrics as the input features. Experimental results indicate that SURF achieves a higher direction prediction accuracy and reduced execution time in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods that support a direction-optimizing BFS. SURF yields up to a 5.62× and 3.15× speedup over the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks Gunrock and Enterprise, respectively.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of the GA, several non-AI techniques are implemented such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A-Star Algorithm (A*), Dijkstra Algorithm (DA), and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS). Genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution. The non-AI algorithms make use of graph concepts together with underlying data structures to solve randomly generated mazes. This paper also shows the results obtained from five different experiments after implementing the complete system and executing each of the non-AI algorithms as well as the GA. The strongest results after executing each algorithm, that is, the number of steps and the time taken to solve the maze were recorded and graphs were plotted to compare the performance of the GA compared to the non-AI algorithms. The GA always found the shortest path but becomes slower than the non-AI algorithms for dimensions greater than 10x 10.},
